Both the Python and Matlab files implement a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the language in which a sentence is written.

To do that, we use counts of "trigrams" (sequences of three consecutive letters) extracted from several texts in:
    - Portuguese
    - English
    - Spanish
    - French
I got hold of this data while attending a course on Machine Learning in my college and I have no idea where they took it from :(

The algorithm here is pretty vanilla and has no noteworthy optimizations or variations or whatnot.
To classify a sentence just type it in and press 'Enter'.

I would also like to mention that the Python version was mainly written by a colleague of mine; she was merely under my guidance.
