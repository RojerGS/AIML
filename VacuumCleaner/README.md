# Vacuum Cleaner

Use a genetic algorithm with asexual reproduction to produce increasingly better robots to clean rooms.

You can read about part of the work here: http://mathspp.blogspot.com/2018/08/teaching-robot-how-to-vacuum-clean-with.html

WBasicSimulator.jar is an executable that runs a simulation over a specified number of generations and then plays the animation of the best individual cleaning a room.

AppSimulator.java is the final product I am working towards.

TODO:
  - Learn how to use SwingWorker so that the simulation doesn't run on the same thread as the GUI;
  - Create a crossover algorithm for decision trees;
  - Think of something to help distinguish the walls better;
  - Try a smoother (random) distribution of the dirt in the room;
  - Generalize the shape of the room;
  - ...
