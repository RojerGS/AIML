**Solving the Hanoi Towers with Reinforcement Learning**

In this project I will use Reinforcement Learning and, in particular, Markov Decision Processes to solve the problem of the Hanoi Towers.
This is project is being explained in a blog series that you can find logged [here](http://mathspp.blogspot.com/2018/09/pledging-to-do-100-days-of-machine.html), of which [this](http://mathspp.blogspot.com/2018/09/markov-decision-processes-basics.html) is the first post.

This was brought to you by the [#100DaysOfMLCode](http://mathspp.blogspot.com/2018/09/pledging-to-do-100-days-of-machine.html) initiative!
